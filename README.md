3. Close all additional windows so there is just a page icon and text in the center of the screen

7. Hold control and click the 2nd link that says `http://localhost:6060`

8. If asked, sign in with the same google account and bookmark the link that opens. 

 

You can close the cloud shell tab and the proxy should stay open. If you would like to manually close the proxy, go back to the terminal and press Ctrl C (System Interrupt).

 

 

 

 

 

TO REOPEN THE PROXY IF IT CLOSES:

1. Open https://shell.cloud.google.com/

2. Sign in with the same account you used last time

3. Open and maximize the terminal again by using the steps 4 and 5 above.

4. Type the following into the terminal and press enter afterward:

The same SPACE output should appear. The same bookmarked link should work, but if it does not:

5. Open the new link that says `http://localhost:6060`

6. Replace the old bookmark with the new link.

 



Notes:

- The proxy link will only work on the same browser you use to start the proxy. If you try it on another browser, you can sign into your google account that you used and it should work.

- If your specific proxy link gets blocked, create a new google account and repeat initial steps.

- If google cloud shell gets blocked, womp womp ill find a solution within a few days
